## PROJECT PLANNING

### UX Design

To ensure our project was user-centric, we began by conducting thorough user research to gather insights and understand the target audience’s needs. This foundational step informed the creation of wireframes for the main pages, where we meticulously defined the layout and user flow to provide a seamless experience. We then determined a cohesive thematic style that visually represented the website’s intended appearance, incorporating appropriate colours, typography, and design elements. Throughout the process, we collaborated closely to ensure the feasibility of our design concepts. This included providing essential design assets, such as images and icons, required for the website’s implementation.

As we moved into the implementation phase, we focused on accurately translating the design into HTML and CSS. Usability testing was conducted across various devices to guarantee a consistent and intuitive user experience. We conducted comprehensive usability testing sessions, gathering feedback from real users to guide further improvements. Regular reviews were carried out to verify that the website’s design aligned with the initial wireframes and mockups, ensuring consistency and coherence. All team members contributed to the preparation of the final presentation, highlighting our design decisions and the user-centric features implemented to enhance the overall experience.

## Agile Methodology

Throughout this project, our team implemented Agile methodology by using a Kanban board to efficiently manage tasks and ensure a smooth workflow. Utilizing GitHub Project Boards, we set up various user issues, assigning them to team members based on their expertise and availability. This allowed us to visually track the progress of each task, identify bottlenecks, and prioritize work effectively. 

By continuously updating the board and holding regular stand-ups, we maintained clear communication and quickly adapted to any changes, ensuring that we delivered high-quality results in a timely manner. Additionally, the use of GitHub Issues enabled us to document each task with detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, and labels for easy categorization. This structured approach facilitated clear accountability and enhanced collaboration within the team, helping us achieve our project goals efficiently. 

Before deployment, we verified that all tasks on the Kanban board were completed and the website was ready for launch. The deployment process was coordinated to ensure the website was hosted on the chosen cloud platform without any issues. All team members contributed to the preparation of the final presentation, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all project aspects.

## AI Tools

### Development Process

To help generate the user stories for our project, AI produced a structured process to identify the needs and goals of different stakeholders, such as students and teachers. We crafted our prompts specifically for user stories in a format that clearly articulated the desired outcomes and motivations: "As a ..., I want to..., so I can..." and requested these needs to be processed into acceptance criteria and tasks. This approach ensured that each story was user-centric and aligned with the overall project objectives.

As we worked through the user stories we refined our prompts as necessary to ensure clarity and specificity.
This iterative process allowed us to hone in on the exact requirements and steps needed to meet our UX design goals, and Agile performances, resulting in comprehensive and actionable user stories. By refining our prompts, we could better capture the nuances of each user's needs and ensure that the development process remained focused and aligned with the desired outcomes.

This thorough and systematic method enabled us to create a detailed roadmap for developing the educational card matching game. It ensured the game was engaging, effective, and tailored to the needs of its users, ultimately enhancing the learning experience for Key Stage 3 students.

### Generating Code

We utilized AI tools to assist in the initial code generation for our card matching game. By leveraging AI, we were able to quickly establish the foundation of our application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This strategic use of AI enabled us to generate responsive layouts and interactive elements efficiently, ensuring that our code adhered to best practices and standards. For instance, the AI tools helped us create the card matching game interface, which included smooth, dynamic interactions with a focus on DOM-manipulation, significantly reducing the time required for manual coding.

### Debugging Code

AI tools were also instrumental in debugging our code. Throughout development, we utilized AI to continuously analyze various aspects of our code which enabled us to identify and resolve code issues promptly through providing suggestions for resolving them. This included detecting syntax errors and optimizing code performance, which ensured a smooth and error-free user experience. For instance, AI-driven optimizations helped us fine-tune the HTML, CSS and JavaScript, resulting in a more error-free, engaging gameplay experience for our target audience.


### Reflections on AI

On reflection, the integration of AI into our project development process has essentially brought about a paradigm shift. It enabled us to speed up our workflow, work smarter and more efficiently. By automating mundane tasks, providing intelligent code suggestions, and offering real-time debugging and optimization; In summary, AI tools have supported us in delivering a polished, educational web app game aimed at Science Key Stage 3 students.
